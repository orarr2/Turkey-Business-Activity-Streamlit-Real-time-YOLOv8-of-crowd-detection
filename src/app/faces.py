"""Face DETECTION (and privacy blurring) - never face identification.

Scope, stated up front because it matters: this module finds face
RECTANGLES. It computes no face embeddings, keeps no face database and
matches nobody against anything - the project's "have I seen this
before?" question stays answered by body-appearance re-ID (app/reid.py),
which is the honest tool at street-camera distance where a face is a
dozen pixels. What face boxes ARE good for here:

  * `--blur-faces` (collector) - privacy mode: every snapshot the
    pipeline publishes (anomaly frames, model view, event crops + full
    frames, heatmap base) gets its faces gaussian-blurred BEFORE the
    bytes leave the process. Detection, counting and re-ID all run on the
    unblurred in-memory frame first, so enabling the flag changes nothing
    about the numbers - only about what viewers of the dashboard see;
  * deep-window annotation - face boxes drawn on the analysis frame
    (close-range cameras), the classic "face 0.87" overlay.

Detector: OpenCV's bundled YuNet (cv2.FaceDetectorYN) driving a ~230 KB
ONNX file - no new python dependency. The model file is NOT committed;
point `FACE_MODEL` at a downloaded copy (see README). Everything here
degrades to a silent no-op when the file or the cv2 API is absent:
`available()` returns False, `maybe_blur()` returns the frame untouched,
`detect_faces()` returns []. A missing optional model must never cost a
sample.
