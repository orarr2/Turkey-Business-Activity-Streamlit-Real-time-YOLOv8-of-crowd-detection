"""Skeleton keypoints for person detections (COCO-17, opt-in).

The counting pipeline only needs boxes; this module adds WHAT THE BODY IS
DOING on top of them - the input for the behavior labels ("fell over",
"crouching") and the gesture pass ("hand raised", "waving") that boxes
alone cannot answer.

Design constraints, in order:

  * the detection model stays the single source of truth for WHO exists.
    The pose model (yolov8n-pose by default) runs as a SECOND pass and its
    skeletons are matched onto the detector's `person` boxes by IoU - a
    pose-person with no matching detection is discarded, never counted.
    Counts can therefore never change because pose ran;
  * additive, in place - a matched box dict gains a `"kps"` key
    ([[x, y, conf] x 17]) exactly like the tracker's `track_id` and the
    speed pass's `kmh`. Every existing consumer (counts, ROI filters,
    draw_boxes, re-ID) reads only the keys it knows, so nothing downstream
    needs changing;
  * lazy + optional - the model loads on first use only. The 24/7 VM
    round never loads it unless the operator passes `--pose` (two YOLO
    models + the OSNet embedder do not fit the 1 GB e2-micro; the flag is
    for >=2 GB hosts). The natural home is the on-demand deep window
    (`behavior.analyze_window(pose=True)`), which already accepts the cost
    of extra inference per click.

This module imports nothing heavy at module level so the pure matching
logic stays unit-testable on any machine.

    Why: on a street cam a pedestrian is 30-120 px tall; a full-frame pose
    pass at 640 hands the model ~15 px of person and finds nothing, so
    gestures/fall/crouch got no input at all on exactly the scenes they
    exist for. Cropping each detector box (padded 25%) and letting the
    pose model see it at `imgsz` multiplies the effective resolution per
    person by 5-15x. The detector stays the source of truth for WHO
    exists: only its `person` boxes are cropped, and the best pose-person
    inside each crop claims that box - there is nothing else it could be.
    Boxes shorter than `min_box_h` px are skipped - below that even a
    dedicated crop holds no limbs, only upscaling artifacts. `max_crops`
    bounds the per-call cost on crowded frames: the TALLEST boxes win
    (closest people = the ones whose skeletons are actually legible).

    Cost: one small inference per person, run crop-by-crop - a static

    torch and OpenVINO checkpoints interchangeable.
