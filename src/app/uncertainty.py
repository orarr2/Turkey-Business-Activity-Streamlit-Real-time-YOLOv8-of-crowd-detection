"""Per-box uncertainty at capture time (plan WS1, decision D1).

Every crop/frame box the collector stores carries ``uncertainty`` in [0, 1]:
how much a human verdict on this detection would teach the system. Two
components, both nearly free on the e2-micro:

  * margin  - distance of the box conf from its EFFECTIVE class gate (the
    boosted/night-adjusted one actually used for the burst, not the shipped
    default): 1.0 at the gate, falling linearly to 0 at gate +- span. A box
    at its threshold is exactly the box the model was on the fence about.
  * flip delta (optional, sampled bursts only, UNCERTAINTY_FLIP=1) - ONE
    extra pass on the horizontally-flipped frame; per-box IoU-matched conf
    delta. A detection whose confidence moves (or vanishes) under a mirror
    flip is unstable evidence. Costs a single extra inference on the ~1-in-N
    bursts that get sampled, not T=10 on all (the spec's MC-Dropout was
    rejected in D1: yolov8 detection models carry zero Dropout modules).

Aggregate: ``0.6 * margin + 0.4 * flip`` (flip term 0 when disabled), same
downstream contract the spec asked for. Persistence is the callers' job:
review_frames writes the field into the sidecar json, live_samples encodes
it as a ``_uNN`` filename suffix.
