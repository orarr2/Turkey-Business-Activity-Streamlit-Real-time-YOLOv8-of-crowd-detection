"""Long-horizon presence heatmap: WHERE activity stands, weighted by time.

Every successful sample already computes gated + ROI-filtered boxes; this
module banks each box's FOOT POINT (bottom-center, the same convention the
ROI filter uses) into a coarse normalized grid, weighted by the seconds
the observation "covers" (the gap since this camera's previous sample). A
person planted in one spot for ten minutes therefore accumulates ~15x the
weight of a passer-by crossing one sample - the map reads as dwell, not
just traffic.

Three layers per camera - `person`, `vehicles` (the road set, same
VEHICLE_NAMES convention as the counts), `other` (train + any
EXTRA_CLASSES additions) - each split into four local-time dayparts so
"where do people stand at night" and "where does the morning rush stack
up" are separate answers. Weights decay a few percent per day, so the map
follows the street's CURRENT layout instead of fossilizing a construction
detour forever.

Costs nothing measurable: pure accumulation from already-computed boxes,
one small JSON per camera (data/heatmap_<cam>.json), zero Firestore
writes. Rendering (cv2 colormap over the live frame) happens every
RENDER_EVERY_SAMPLES samples per camera and on demand from the dashboard.
