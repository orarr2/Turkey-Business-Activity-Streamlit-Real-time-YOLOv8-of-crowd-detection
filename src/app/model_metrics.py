"""Model-quality scoreboard, computed from user review verdicts.

The dashboard's "Model: X% accuracy · P(person) Y% · FP Z% · N reviews"
header line is driven by ``compute()`` in this module. All numbers come
from ``data/reviews.json`` (the ReviewStore) - nothing here reads live
inference, so a caller can trust it and cache it without invalidation
tricks.

Percent-metrics need a MINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE to be meaningful. 3/3 correct
is technically 100% but says nothing about the model - it says the user
happened to review three easy crops. Below ``MIN_REVIEWS_FOR_METRIC``
``header_line()`` reports N/A + a progress hint instead of a fabricated
percentage, so the dashboard never shows a trustworthy-looking 100%
against a two-digit sample. Same rule applies to per-class precision.

Definitions used here (crop-level, until the full-frame review UX ships
its own recall data):

  correct       = user said the label the model gave was right
  wrong         = user said the label was wrong (either wrong class OR
                  not an object at all)
  accuracy      = correct / (correct + wrong)
  precision[c]  = correct[c] / (correct[c] + wrong[c])
                  where ``c`` is the class the model originally gave
  fp_rate       = wrong / (correct + wrong)
                  = 1 - accuracy in the crop-level model

`recall` is left off intentionally: without "the model missed this object
here" verdicts we cannot count FN. The full-frame review UX (Task 26)
adds a ``missed`` verdict, at which point ``compute()`` grows an
``recall`` field per class.

# Below this many verdicts the % metrics are treated as unavailable in the
# UI (header_line reports N/A + progress). 20 balances "quick to reach"

# n=20 is already ~10 pp, low enough that a 60% vs 90% distinction is
# real signal rather than coin flips.
MIN_REVIEWS_FOR_METRIC = 20
# Per-class precision needs its own minimum. Kept lower than the global

# Crop reviews under this prefix come from the shipped bootstrap fixtures,
